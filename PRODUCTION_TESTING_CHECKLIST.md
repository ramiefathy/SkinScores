## üß™ Edge Case Testing

### Validation Testing
- [ ] Try submitting each form with empty required fields
- [ ] Enter out-of-range numbers where applicable
- [ ] Test decimal inputs where allowed (e.g., PASI, HAQ-DI)

### Calculation Edge Cases
- [ ] Test minimum scores (all zeros/lowest options)
- [ ] Test maximum scores (all highest options)
- [ ] Test negative scores where applicable (ALDEN, RegiSCAR)

### UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Test on mobile device (responsive layout)
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation (Tab through fields)
- [ ] Test browser back/forward buttons
- [ ] Test page refresh (form state persistence)

---

## üìä Performance Testing

- [ ] Tool loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Form submission responds within 1 second
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] Memory usage stable (no leaks)

---

## üîê Security Testing

- [ ] XSS: Try entering `<script>alert('test')</script>` in text fields
- [ ] SQL Injection: Not applicable (NoSQL database)
- [ ] Input sanitization working correctly
