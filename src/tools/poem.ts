  description:
    'The POEM is a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that quantifies eczema severity from the patient’s perspective. POEM is a simple 7-question survey focusing on frequency of eczema symptoms (itch, sleep loss, bleeding, weeping, cracking, flaking, dryness) over the past week.',
  sourceType: 'Research',
  icon: MessageSquare,
  rationale:
    'The POEM consists of seven items, each addressing a core symptom: itching, sleep disturbance, bleeding, weeping/oozing, cracking, flaking, and dryness/roughness. Each item is scored from 0 ("no days") to 4 ("every day"), for a total score range of 0 to 28. Severity bands are defined as 0–7 (mild), 8–19 (moderate), and 20–28 (severe). A change of ≥3 points is considered the minimal clinically important difference (MCID).',
  clinicalPerformance:
    "The POEM has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86), construct validity, and responsiveness in both clinical trials and real-world practice. It correlates moderately to strongly with other patient-reported and clinician-reported measures, including the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), ItchyQOL, and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). Test-retest reliability is good, and the POEM is feasible for use in both research and clinical settings, with a median completion time of 1 minute.\n\nValidation and Comparative Studies\nThe POEM has been validated in multiple populations and languages. Comparative studies have shown that the POEM has better measurement properties than the Patient-Oriented Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (PO-SCORAD) and is more strongly correlated with quality of life measures. The POEM is the preferred patient-reported outcome for assessing symptoms of atopic dermatitis.\n\nReal-World Implementation\nThe POEM is widely used due to its brevity, patient-centered focus, and strong psychometric properties. Barriers include limited awareness among some clinicians and a lack of integration into EHRs, while facilitators include its ease of use and alignment with patient-centered care.",
