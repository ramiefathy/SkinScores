  rationale:
    'The CTCAE, developed by the National Cancer Institute, is the standard clinician-reported outcome measure for grading the severity of adverse events, including dermatologic toxicities, in oncology trials and practice. The rationale is to provide a reproducible, standardized framework for reporting the type and severity of skin toxicities (e.g., rash, pruritus, xerosis, paronychia, alopecia) associated with cancer therapies, facilitating consistent communication, regulatory reporting, and clinical decision-making. Each skin event is graded independently on a scale from 1 (mild) to 5 (death related to adverse event), based on objective criteria such as body surface area involved, impact on activities of daily living, and need for intervention.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'A 2024 systematic review by Shaigany et al. found that the CTCAE is the most frequently used instrument for grading dermatologic adverse events in cancer trials, but formal psychometric validation is limited. For acneiform rash, the CTCAE demonstrated sufficient construct validity, with strong correlations to other clinician-reported outcome measures (e.g., MESTT, ρ = 0.73) and moderate to high correlations with patient-reported outcome measures (e.g., FACT-EGFRI-18, ρ = 0.60; ESS, ρ = 0.91). For other skin toxicities, such as pruritus, xerosis, paronychia, and alopecia, construct validity is less robust, and reliability data are largely absent except for acneiform rash, where moderate to strong interrater reliability has been reported. Sensitivity and specificity are not reported, as the CTCAE is not a diagnostic tool. In pediatric populations, the CTCAE has been adapted into the Pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes version (Ped-PRO-CTCAE), which has demonstrated strong construct validity and moderate to high test-retest reliability for symptom adverse events in children aged 7–18 years, though not specifically for skin toxicities. Studies have shown poor-to-fair agreement between clinician-reported CTCAE grades and child or caregiver-reported outcomes, with clinicians tending to underreport the severity of symptomatic adverse events compared to patients and caregivers.',
