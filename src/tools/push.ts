  rationale:
    'The PUSH tool was developed to provide a standardized, evidence-based method for monitoring the healing of pressure ulcers over time. The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) formally recommended the PUSH tool to address the lack of consistency and objectivity in traditional wound assessments, which often relied on subjective clinical impressions and non-standardized documentation methods. The PUSH tool (version 3.0) assesses three key parameters: Wound surface area (measured as length × width in centimeters, then converted to a score from 0 to 10), Exudate amount (scored from 0 (none) to 3 (heavy)), and Tissue type (scored from 0 (closed/resurfaced) to 4 (necrotic tissue)). The total PUSH score is the sum of these three subscores, with a maximum possible score of 17. Higher scores indicate more severe or less healed ulcers. The tool is designed for regular use (e.g., weekly) to monitor healing trajectories.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'A prospective study in nursing home residents demonstrated that PUSH scores decreased significantly over time in healing ulcers, and the tool could differentiate between healing and non-healing ulcers. PUSH scores were highly correlated with both the Pressure Sore Status Tool and direct surface area measurements, supporting its construct validity. Another large prospective study confirmed the tool’s internal and external responsiveness, showing that PUSH could detect statistically significant changes in wound healing across a variety of acute and chronic wound types. The effect size statistics were large, confirming the tool’s sensitivity to clinically meaningful changes. While the PUSH tool is generally considered reliable, a retrospective study in a skilled nursing facility found only modest agreement between PUSH scores and traditional nursing assessments (kappa statistics ranging from 0.007 to 0.298), highlighting the importance of standardized documentation. A survey of clinicians found that most agreed it was easy to use, reliable, and not overly time-consuming. There is limited evidence regarding its use in pediatric populations.',
