  description:
    'The CDLQI is a pediatric adaptation of the DLQI, designed to assess the impact of skin diseases on the quality of life of children aged 4 to 16 years. It consists of 10 items, each scored from 0 to 3, covering symptoms, feelings, leisure, school, personal relationships, sleep, and treatment.',

  rationale:
    'The CDLQI is a pediatric adaptation of the DLQI, designed to assess the impact of skin diseases on the quality of life of children aged 4 to 16 years. It recognizes that children experience and express the burden of dermatological conditions differently from adults, affecting school performance, social interactions, and family dynamics. The CDLQI consists of 10 items, each scored from 0 to 3, with a total score range of 0 to 30. The items are tailored to be age-appropriate and cover similar domains as the adult DLQI. The CDLQI is typically reported as a single total score, though domain subscores can be calculated for research purposes.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'The CDLQI demonstrates high internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values typically ranging from 0.82 to 0.92 in both original and translated versions. Test-retest reliability is also high, with a Cantonese validation study reporting a test-retest correlation (gamma) of 0.958 over a 7-day interval. The CDLQI is not designed as a diagnostic tool, so sensitivity, specificity, and AUC are not typically reported. The CDLQI has been validated in 44 languages and six cultural adaptations, with evidence of high reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change. Comparative studies confirm its utility in a wide range of pediatric dermatological conditions. Content validity has been rated as sufficient for use in atopic eczema and other conditions. Limitations of the CDLQI mirror those of the DLQI, including potential underrepresentation of certain domains and the challenge of proxy versus self-report in pediatric populations. The instrument may not address all pediatric-specific impacts, and content validity concerns have been raised in some contexts.',
