  description:
    'The PSSI was developed as a modification of the PASI to specifically assess the severity of scalp psoriasis, a common and therapeutically challenging site.',

  sourceType: 'Clinical Guideline',
  icon: User,
  rationale:
    'The rationale was to provide a standardized, objective measure for scalp involvement, which is often underrepresented in global severity indices. The scalp is divided into four quadrants. For each quadrant, erythema, induration, and scaling are scored from 0 to 4. The score for each quadrant is calculated as the sum of the three parameters multiplied by the percentage of area involved (expressed as a decimal). The total PSSI score is the sum of the scores for all four quadrants, with a range of 0 to 72.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'The PSSI has been used in clinical trials to monitor response to scalp-targeted therapies, but there is limited published data on its reliability, validity, or comparative performance in routine practice. It is considered a useful tool for detailed assessment of scalp involvement, but its complexity and time requirements may limit its use outside of research settings. No recent validation or head-to-head comparative studies were found in the provided references.',
