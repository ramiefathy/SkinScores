  rationale:
    'The Acne-QoL is a disease-specific HRQoL instrument developed to assess the impact of facial acne on adult patients. It was designed to capture the unique psychosocial and functional impairments associated with acne, which may not be adequately measured by generic or dermatology-specific tools. The Acne-QoL consists of 19 items, each scored on a 7-point Likert scale (0 to 6), with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The instrument is divided into four domains: self-perception (7 items), role-social (5 items), role-emotional (5 items), and acne symptoms (2 items). Each domain score is calculated by summing the scores of the items within that domain, and the total score is the sum of all domain scores, with a possible range of 0 to 114.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'The Acne-QoL demonstrates high internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values for the total score and subscales typically exceeding 0.85, and ranging from 0.74 to 0.96 for various subdomains. Test-retest reliability is also high, with ICCs between 0.88 and 0.97 over a 24-hour interval in real-world studies. The Acne-QoL is not designed as a diagnostic tool, so sensitivity, specificity, and AUC are not typically reported. Systematic reviews have confirmed the Acne-QoL’s strong psychometric properties, including sufficient internal consistency, construct validity, and responsiveness. Comparative studies indicate that the Acne-QoL performs well relative to other acne-specific and dermatology-specific instruments, though no single PROM has demonstrated clear superiority in all domains. The Acne-QoL’s domain structure may not reflect all patient experiences, and cross-cultural validation is less extensive than for the DLQI or CDLQI. Some studies have noted floor effects in certain subdomains, and qualitative research has highlighted variability in patient perceptions of the instrument’s relevance and acceptability.',
