    'A severity-of-illness score to predict mortality in patients with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).',

  rationale:
    'SCORTEN is a severity-of-illness score developed specifically to predict mortality in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The rationale for its development was the inadequacy of general severity scores (such as the Simplified Acute Physiology Score and burn scores) in this unique patient population, which led to the need for a disease-specific prognostic tool. SCORTEN was derived and validated using logistic regression modeling in a French cohort of SJS/TEN patients, identifying seven independent risk factors for mortality:\n\nAge >40 years\nPresence of malignancy\nHeart rate >120/min\nInitial percentage of epidermal detachment >10%\nSerum urea >10 mmol/L\nSerum glucose >14 mmol/L\nSerum bicarbonate <20 mmol/L\n\nEach risk factor present scores one point, for a total possible score of 0–7. The probability of death increases with the number of risk factors present, and the score is typically calculated within 24 hours of admission, with recalculation on day 3 recommended for improved prognostic accuracy.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'SCORTEN has been extensively validated in multiple cohorts and settings. The original validation demonstrated excellent calibration (expected vs. observed mortality: 19.6% vs. 20%) and discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] of 0.82). Subsequent studies and meta-analyses have confirmed its reasonable accuracy, with pooled standardized mortality ratios (SMR) close to 1, indicating good predictive performance. However, SCORTEN tends to overestimate mortality at higher scores, particularly in contemporary cohorts and in patients treated with immunomodulatory therapy. The discriminative power remains acceptable (AUC 0.75–0.83), but calibration may be affected by changes in supportive care and treatment protocols over time. Serial calculation (e.g., on day 3) may improve predictive accuracy. In pediatric populations, SCORTEN predicts morbidity and outcome, with higher scores correlating with longer hospital stays and increased complications, although mortality is rare in children. The tool’s reliability is supported by consistent associations between higher scores and worse outcomes, but interrater reliability and test-retest reliability have not been systematically reported.',
