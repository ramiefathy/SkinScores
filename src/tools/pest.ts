  description:
    'The Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST) was developed to address the underdiagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) among patients with psoriasis, particularly in non-rheumatology settings.',

  rationale:
    'The tool was designed to be simple, rapid, and feasible for use by dermatologists and primary care providers to identify patients who may require rheumatologic evaluation. The PEST consists of five yes/no questions and a manikin diagram for patients to indicate joint involvement. Each "yes" response on the PEST scores 1 point, for a total possible score of 0 to 5. A score of â‰¥3 is considered suggestive of PsA and warrants further rheumatologic assessment.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    "The PEST has demonstrated high sensitivity and moderate specificity.\nOriginal Development: Sensitivity of 0.94 and specificity of 0.78.\nJapanese Cohort: Sensitivity of 93.1% and specificity of 78.9%.\nBrazilian Portuguese Validation: Sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 63.3%, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.81 and a Cronbach's alpha of 0.72.\nPediatric Pilot Study: Sensitivity and specificity of 100% for juvenile PsA, outperforming the Early Arthritis for Psoriatic Patients (EARP) questionnaire.\n\nIn primary care, the PEST had a sensitivity of 0.68 and specificity of 0.71, outperforming the PASE and EARP in terms of balanced accuracy.\n\nValidation and Comparative Studies\nThe PEST has been validated in multiple languages and populations, including Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese cohorts, confirming its psychometric properties and clinical utility. Comparative studies in European and North American dermatology clinics have shown that the PEST, PASQ, and ToPAS are all useful for screening, with the PEST offering a favorable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\n\nReal-World Implementation\nThe PEST is widely used in dermatology clinics and is increasingly being integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems to enable automated screening. This integration has been shown to increase clinician adoption and sustained use with minimal impact on visit duration. The PEST is brief, easy to administer, and correlates with patient-reported quality of life, as higher PEST scores are associated with lower Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores. Barriers include the potential for over-referral and the need for standardized follow-up protocols.",
