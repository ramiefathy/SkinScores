  rationale:
    'The HS-PGA is a global, physician-reported outcome measure designed to assess overall HS severity, primarily for use in clinical trials. It is based on lesion counts and the extent of involvement, providing a standardized, reproducible anchor for disease severity. The HS-PGA is typically a 6-point scale: 0: Clear (no inflammatory or non-inflammatory nodules), 1: Minimal (1 nodule or abscess), 2: Mild (2–5 nodules or abscesses), 3: Moderate (6–10 nodules or abscesses), 4: Severe (11–20 nodules or abscesses), 5: Very severe (>20 nodules or abscesses). Some versions may include additional criteria such as the presence of draining tunnels or the number of affected regions. The scale is categorical, with no formal subscores.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'The HS-PGA has demonstrated high intrarater reliability (ICC > 0.75) and moderate interrater reliability, with performance comparable to other major scoring systems. It correlates well with IHS4 and other severity measures (ρ > 0.6), and moderately with patient-reported outcomes such as DLQI. However, the HS-PGA may be less sensitive to small but clinically meaningful changes in disease activity compared to lesion-based scores such as IHS4 or HiSCR.',
