  description:
    'The SALT score quantifies the extent of scalp hair loss in alopecia areata as a percentage of total scalp area. It is calculated by summing the weighted percentage of hair loss from four scalp regions: Vertex (40%), Right Side (18%), Left Side (18%), and Posterior (24%).',
  sourceType: 'Research',
  icon: UserMinus, // Placeholder icon
  rationale:
    'The SALT score was developed to provide a standardized, quantitative assessment of scalp hair loss in patients with alopecia areata (AA). The rationale was to enable consistent measurement of disease extent for both clinical trials and routine practice, facilitating objective monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy. The SALT score divides the scalp into four regions, each assigned a percentage based on its relative surface area: Vertex (40%), Right profile (18%), Left profile (18%), and Posterior (24%). For each region, the percentage of hair loss is estimated visually. The regional percentage hair loss is multiplied by the region’s weight, and the sum of all four regions gives the total SALT score, which ranges from 0 (no hair loss) to 100 (complete scalp hair loss).',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'A large cross-sectional study of 303 patients with AA demonstrated that higher SALT scores were associated with longer disease duration, nail involvement, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, supporting the tool’s construct validity. Trichoscopic markers of disease activity also correlated with SALT scores. Automated image analysis has been developed to standardize scoring, with an absolute error of 7% compared to manual scoring, which is within the range of inter-rater variability. However, formal inter-rater and intra-rater reliability statistics are infrequently reported.',
