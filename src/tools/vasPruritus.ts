  description:
    'The VAS Pruritus is a unidimensional, patient-reported outcome measure designed to quantify the intensity of itch. Its primary purpose is to provide a simple, rapid, and reproducible method for patients to communicate the severity of their pruritus, which is inherently subjective and difficult to quantify objectively.',
  sourceType: 'Research',
  icon: SlidersHorizontal,
  rationale:
    'The VAS is typically presented as a 100-mm horizontal or vertical line, anchored by descriptors at each end (e.g., "no itch" at 0 mm and "worst imaginable itch" at 100 mm). Patients are instructed to mark a point on the line that best represents their itch intensity over a specified recall period, commonly the past 24 hours. The score is calculated by measuring the distance in millimeters from the "no itch" anchor to the patient\'s mark, yielding a value from 0 to 100. The VAS provides a single, continuous measure of itch intensity and does not have constituent subscores. The VAS has been widely used in symptom assessment for decades, but its application to pruritus was systematically validated by Reich et al., who demonstrated its reliability and validity in a large, multinational cohort of patients with pruritic dermatoses. Additional validation and comparative studies, such as those by Phan et al., have reinforced its psychometric properties in the context of pruritus.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'Multiple studies have established the VAS as a reliable and valid measure of pruritus intensity. Reich et al. found very good reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] > 0.8) and strong concurrent validity with other intensity scales such as the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Verbal Rating Scale (VRS). Phan et al. reported high reliability and concurrent validity (r > 0.8, p < 0.01) for the VAS, NRS, and VRS, with high inter-scale correlations and minimal missing data. Jang et al. confirmed strong correlation and similar retest reliability between VAS, NRS, and VRS in a large multicenter study. Systematic reviews have consistently rated the VAS (horizontal format) as one of the most appropriate patient-reported outcome measures for pruritus, with adequate reliability and validity for use in clinical trials. The VAS is also included in comprehensive pruritus assessment batteries, such as PRURITOOLS, which demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (ICC 0.84–1) and strong convergent validity with other pruritus measures. The VAS has been validated in real-world, multicenter, and practice-based studies across Europe and Asia, confirming its reproducibility and internal consistency in diverse clinical settings and patient populations. The VAS for "worst itch in the last 24 hours" was found to be the most reproducible and consistent across languages and disease types. In a large German study, both patients and physicians rated the VAS as highly feasible and useful for routine clinical care, supporting its integration into daily workflows. The European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Task Force Pruritus has prioritized the VAS as a primary tool for routine clinical assessment of itch intensity. As a continuous, subjective measure of symptom intensity, the VAS is not designed for diagnostic sensitivity or specificity. Instead, its clinical performance is evaluated in terms of reliability (test-retest, inter-scale), validity (concurrent, convergent), and responsiveness to change. The VAS has demonstrated high responsiveness in clinical trials and real-world studies, with changes in VAS scores correlating with clinical improvement or worsening of pruritus. While the VAS is feasible and interpretable for older children and adolescents, its use in younger children may be limited by cognitive and developmental factors, necessitating the use of proxy reporting or age-adapted instruments. Recent studies have developed and validated age-appropriate pruritus assessment tools (e.g., ItchyQuant, TweenItchyQoL, PIQ-C) for children, which may be preferable for younger age groups. The VAS has been included in some pediatric studies, but high-quality, pediatric-specific validation remains limited.',
