  description:
    "The UCT is a patient-reported outcome measure developed to assess disease control in chronic urticaria from the patient's perspective. It complements the UAS7 by capturing the impact of urticaria on daily life, treatment efficacy, and overall disease control.",
  sourceType: 'Research',
  icon: CheckCircle,
  rationale:
    'The UCT consists of four items, each scored from 0 to 4, for a total score of 0 to 16. The items address symptom frequency, interference with daily activities, treatment efficacy, and overall disease control over the previous four weeks. Higher scores indicate better disease control. A 7-day recall version (UCT7) has also been developed and validated, with similar scoring and interpretive thresholds. A score of 12 or higher indicates well-controlled disease, while a score below 12 suggests poorly controlled urticaria. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for improvement is 2 points.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    "The UCT has demonstrated strong psychometric properties in multiple languages and populations: Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.91 (UCT7), 0.73 (pediatric UCT)), Test-retest reliability (ICC 0.83 (UCT7)), strong convergent validity with disease activity and QoL measures, and good screening accuracy (AUC 0.82 for poorly controlled disease in children). The UCT is sensitive to change and has been validated for both adult and pediatric populations, including in diverse cultural settings.",
