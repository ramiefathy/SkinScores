  description:
    'Developed by H.J. Hurley, this is a simple, widely used system to classify the long-term, anatomical severity of Hidradenitis Suppurativa based on the presence and extent of sinus tracts and scarring. It is a static, three-stage classification that guides prognosis and therapeutic decisions.',

  rationale:
    'Hurley staging is the most established and widely used system for classifying HS severity in clinical practice. Its primary purpose is to stratify patients into broad categories based on the presence and extent of sinus tracts and scarring, with direct implications for therapeutic decision-making. The system is simple, static, and categorical, making it suitable for initial assessment and long-term management planning. Hurley staging consists of three stages: Stage I (abscesses only), Stage II (recurrent abscesses with tracts/scarring), and Stage III (diffuse/interconnected disease).',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'Hurley staging is recommended by the United States and Canadian Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundations for routine clinical use due to its simplicity and direct relevance to treatment planning. It has demonstrated moderate interrater reliability (κ = 0.59) and substantial intrarater reliability (κ = 0.65), with the highest agreement observed for stage III disease (κ = 0.81–0.82). The system is best for rapid assessment and surgical decision-making but is limited by its static nature and lack of sensitivity to dynamic changes in disease activity. The refined Hurley classification, which subdivides stages I and II, has shown improved correlation with quality of life and objective severity scores.',
