  description:
    'The 5-D Itch Scale is a multidimensional, patient-reported outcome measure for pruritus. It was developed to capture the intensity, duration, change over time, impact on daily activities, and anatomical distribution of itch, addressing the limitations of unidimensional scales.',
  sourceType: 'Research',
  icon: Puzzle,
  rationale:
    'The 5-D Itch Scale assesses five domains, each scored from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe): 1. Duration: Number of days with itch in the past two weeks. 2. Degree: Intensity of itch. 3. Direction: Change in itch over time. 4. Disability: Impact on daily activities (sleep, leisure/social, housework/errands, work/school); the highest score among the four is used. 5. Distribution: Number of body parts affected. The total score is the sum of the five domain scores, ranging from 5 to 25. The scale was developed and validated by Elman et al. in 2010.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'The 5-D Itch Scale demonstrates good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha >0.8) and test-retest reliability (ICC >0.8). It correlates strongly with other measures of itch and quality of life, and is sensitive to change over time. Validation studies in diverse populations, including Black, Asian, and Hispanic groups, confirm its psychometric properties, though optimal cutoff values may vary by ethnicity. The scale is not a diagnostic tool, so sensitivity and specificity are not reported.\n\nValidation and Comparative Studies\nThe 5-D Itch Scale has been validated in patients with chronic pruritus of various etiologies, including liver disease, kidney disease, dermatologic disorders, HIV/AIDS, and burn injuries. Comparative studies with the Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Worst Itch NRS, and ItchyQoL demonstrate strong correlations and support its use as a multidimensional measure. The scale is feasible for use in clinical trials and practice, with a median completion time of 2 minutes.\n\nLimitations and Controversies\nThe scale relies on patient self-report, introducing subjectivity and potential recall bias. It may require adaptation for pediatric or cognitively impaired populations. The weighting of domains is arbitrary, and the scale may be less sensitive to change in mild or fluctuating symptoms. Cultural differences in the perception and reporting of itch may affect responses.',
