    'The PGA is a clinician-rated, static global assessment of psoriasis severity, designed to provide a rapid, standardized evaluation of overall disease severity.',

  rationale:
    'The rationale for its development was to offer a simple alternative or complement to more complex tools such as the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), particularly for use in clinical trials and routine practice. The PGA is typically structured as a 5- or 6-point ordinal scale, with categories such as "clear," "almost clear," "mild," "moderate," and "severe." The assessment is based on the average severity of erythema, induration, and scaling across all involved body areas. The physician assigns a single score reflecting overall severity, without formal subscores. Composite measures, such as the product of PGA and body surface area (PGA × BSA), have been introduced to enhance sensitivity, especially in mild disease.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'The PGA demonstrates a strong correlation with PASI, particularly at higher levels of disease activity. A systematic review found the correlation coefficient (r^2) between PASI 75 and PGA clear/almost clear was 0.92 at 8–16 weeks and 0.89 at 17–24 weeks. A large real-world cohort (BADBIR) showed a Spearman correlation between PGA and PASI of 0.92. The PGA has substantial intrarater reliability and moderate interrater reliability, with ICCs of 0.75–0.80, though these are less than that of PASI or the Lattice System-PGA. While responsive to change, systematic reviews have noted that the 5- and 6-point PGA scales lack robust evidence for content validity compared to more complex instruments.\n\nValidation and Comparative Studies\nMultiple studies have validated the PGA in both clinical trials and real-world settings. Comparative studies have shown that the PGA is substantially redundant with PASI in moderate-to-severe disease. The PGA × BSA composite correlates well with PASI and is simpler to use, particularly in mild disease.\n\nReal-World Implementation\nThe PGA is widely used due to its simplicity and minimal time burden. The American Academy of Dermatology and National Psoriasis Foundation endorse the PGA as a valid and feasible measure. Barriers include variability in scoring among clinicians and a lack of standardized anchors. Facilitators include its integration into composite measures and treat-to-target strategies.',
