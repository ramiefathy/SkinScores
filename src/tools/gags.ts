  description:
    'The Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) is a quantitative, composite scoring system designed to provide a standardized, reproducible measure of acne severity by incorporating both the type and distribution of lesions across different anatomical regions.',
  sourceType: 'Clinical Guideline',
  icon: Calculator,
  rationale:
    'The rationale is to integrate lesion type, number, and regional involvement into a single composite score, improving objectivity and comparability across studies and clinical settings. The GAGS divides the face, chest, and back into six regions, each assigned a factor based on surface area and cosmetic significance. For each region, the most severe lesion type is identified and assigned a grade (0: no lesions, 1: comedones, 2: papules, 3: pustules, 4: nodules). The regional score is calculated as the grade multiplied by the region’s factor, and the total GAGS score is the sum of all regional scores.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'The GAGS has been evaluated in multiple studies and systematic reviews, which report good inter- and intra-rater reliability and practical utility in both research and clinical practice. Comparative studies have found that the GAGS is less time-consuming and more practical than lesion counting, with similar or better reliability. However, subjectivity remains a concern, particularly in the assessment of lesion severity and regional involvement. Sensitivity and specificity are not routinely reported, as the GAGS is not a diagnostic tool. In pediatric populations, the GAGS has been used in adolescent studies, and a multidimensional acne global grading system integrating primary and secondary lesions has been developed and validated in a pediatric cohort (ages 0–21 years), demonstrating good agreement with clinician ratings and treatment decisions. Further validation in adult populations and real-world practice is needed.',
