  rationale:
    'The IGA is a clinician-rated global severity scale used to assess the overall severity of rosacea, integrating multiple clinical features such as erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectasia. It provides a simple, standardized measure for use in clinical trials and practice. The IGA is typically a single-item, 5-point or 7-point ordinal scale, with scores ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) or higher. The score reflects the investigator’s overall impression of disease severity. There are no subscores or domains.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'Internal consistency is not applicable for the IGA. Interobserver reliability is described as poor to moderate, while intraobserver agreement is moderate to strong. Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC may be reported in the context of defining response or remission, but these metrics are highly dependent on the population and study design. The IGA has been validated in clinical trials and real-world practice, with evidence supporting its use as a global severity measure. Comparative studies indicate that while the IGA is simple and reliable, it may not fully reflect the complexity of rosacea or capture all relevant clinical features. Criticisms of the IGA include its lack of specificity, potential for interrater variability, and the risk of obscuring specific features of rosacea. The global score may not adequately capture the heterogeneity of the disease or the impact of individual symptoms.',
