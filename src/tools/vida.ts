  description:
    'The VIDA Score is a clinician-reported outcome measure developed to assess the activity of vitiligo, specifically the degree of disease progression or stability over time. Its purpose is to provide a standardized, semi-quantitative measure of disease activity, which is critical for therapeutic decision-making and for evaluating response to interventions in both clinical trials and practice.',
  sourceType: 'Research',
  icon: Activity,
  rationale:
    'The rationale is to capture the dynamic nature of vitiligo, as disease activity (progression, stability, or regression) is a key determinant of prognosis and treatment strategy. The VIDA Score is based on the patient’s recall of disease activity over a defined period. The most common version uses a 6-point scale, ranging from +4 (active progression in the past 6 weeks) to -1 (stable or regressing for more than 1 year). The score is determined by clinician interview and patient history, and there are no constituent subscores.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'There are no direct validation or comparative studies of the VIDA Score in either adult or pediatric populations in the current literature set. Recent systematic reviews and scoping studies of clinician-reported outcome measures for vitiligo have identified a range of instruments for assessing disease extent, repigmentation, and activity, but the VIDA Score is not among those with robust psychometric evaluation. Instead, newer instruments such as the Vitiligo Disease Activity Score (VDAS), Vitiligo Disease Improvement Score (VDIS), and Vitiligo Signs of Activity Score (VSAS) have undergone more comprehensive validation, demonstrating good to excellent inter- and intrarater reliability, content and construct validity, and feasibility. There are no published real-world, post-marketing, or registry-based validation studies specifically evaluating the reliability or clinical utility of the VIDA Score in routine clinical practice for either adults or children. The absence of pediatric-specific validation data is a significant limitation, and clinicians must rely on extrapolation from adult studies or use alternative measures when assessing disease activity in pediatric vitiligo. No data are available regarding the sensitivity, specificity, or responsiveness of the VIDA Score in either clinical trials or real-world practice. The lack of direct validation studies precludes any assessment of its psychometric properties in these domains. No direct, tool-specific validation or comparative studies of the VIDA Score in pediatric populations have been identified. The current evidence base does not support its use as a validated measure of disease activity in children with vitiligo.',
