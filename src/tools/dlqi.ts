  description:
    'The DLQI is a dermatology-specific HRQoL instrument designed to measure the impact of skin diseases on adult patients’ daily lives. It is a 10-item self-administered questionnaire covering symptoms, feelings, daily activities, leisure, work/school, personal relationships, and treatment over the previous week. Each item scored 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much).',

  rationale:
    'The DLQI is a dermatology-specific HRQoL instrument designed to measure the impact of skin diseases on adult patients’ daily lives. Its purpose is to provide a standardized, validated method for quantifying the effect of dermatological conditions on quality of life, supporting both clinical decision-making and research. The DLQI consists of 10 items, each scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2 = a lot, 3 = very much). The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. While the DLQI covers six conceptual domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work/school, personal relationships, and treatment), it is most commonly reported as a single total score.',
  clinicalPerformance:
    'The DLQI consistently demonstrates high internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values most commonly reported between 0.80 and 0.92. Test-retest reliability is also strong, though specific ICC or Pearson’s r values are not always reported. The DLQI is not designed as a diagnostic tool, so sensitivity, specificity, and AUC are rarely reported or relevant. The DLQI has been validated in over 44 languages and used in a wide range of dermatological conditions. Comparative studies have shown that while the DLQI is widely used and easy to administer, it may be less sensitive than instruments like the Skindex-16 in detecting small impairments, particularly in patients with mild symptoms. The DLQI’s performance varies by disease, severity, and setting, but it remains the most commonly used dermatology-specific HRQoL instrument. Criticisms of the DLQI include its simple additive scoring, which may mask the relative importance of individual items, and limited sensitivity to certain domains, such as psychosocial impacts. Content validity concerns have been raised, particularly regarding its ability to capture the full spectrum of disease burden in diverse populations. Ceiling effects have also been reported, with some patients indicating no quality of life impairment despite significant disease.',
